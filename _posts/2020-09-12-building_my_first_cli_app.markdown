Oh no, I have to build something by myself. Wait there won't be any tests to pass? How will I know what to do? I only have two weeks to do this? There is no way I am going to be able to get this done. Make a gem?! I'm lost and I haven't even started... That is how it all started, but then I remembered that is also how I felt when I started coding in the first place and now I'm here; so I did just as I've done leading to that moment, I read and watched lots of videos. 
	 
I started going through the planning resources lesson and I opened every link that was provided spanned across new tabs and new windows and even onto different monitors to keep all of the resources as organized as I could. After reading a bit I started watching one of the lectures that went over getting started on a project. While watching I tried to follow along adapting to my project the things I was watching, making a gem for the first time and shrugging thinking "I guess it did the thing." 
	 
Once I was past the gem I realized that I kind of knew what I was doing from there, sure I would run into the same typical syntax mistakes and outputs not returning quite EXACTLY what I want and having to google around to figure out how to fix it, but it was then that I realized that I was doing what this was all for, I was devloping, and I was having a blast! A path centered around constantly learning and figuring out solutions to problems I never knew existed.
	 
Finally, after having gotten through building the app to have at least the requirements listed for the project, I see everything the app is missing and I find myself wanting to add to it and plan on doing so to make my app's objects communicate and share better as well as generally pulling in more data from my outside source. All in all I am super excited to be at this point in my path, having just built my first application, a feat that felt so far away when it all began.
